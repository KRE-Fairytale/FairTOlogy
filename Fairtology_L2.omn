Ontology: <http://example.org/fairtale#FairytaleOntology>


Annotations: 
    rdfs:comment "This ontology models the structural and thematic elements of fairy tales across cultural and historical contexts. It includes core narrative components such as character archetypes, moral themes, ending types, and literary modes, as well as distinctions between oral traditions and media adaptations.

The ontology integrates a perspectivisation frame to capture how modern retellings reinterpret traditional narratives. In this model, a background (the original tale or fabula) is represented through a lens (adaptation choices, such as framing the hero as a rebel or emphasizing empowerment), which creates a viewpoint or cut (the reframed moral or emotional focus). The conceptualiser (e.g., producer, studio) constructs the adaptation, and the ontology captures the audience’s attitude toward that reframed version — whether positive, negative, or mixed — based on ratings, reviews, or reception data.

This perspectivisation is not merely rhetorical; it reflects how contemporary interpretations blend narrative roles and values, producing new, culturally resonant meanings (e.g., the transformation of the “villain” into a misunderstood or tragic figure). Through this layered structure, the ontology supports semantic comparison between traditional and modern versions of fairy tales, illuminating shifts in moral focus, character perception, and cultural discourse.",

This ontology is developed as a domain-specific extension of the Perspectivization Ontology (v2.0, Aldo Gangemi, 2024), which models framing events, lenses, and attitudes. We adopt its core structure and reuse relevant classes while specializing it for the domain of folk and fairy tale adaptations."
